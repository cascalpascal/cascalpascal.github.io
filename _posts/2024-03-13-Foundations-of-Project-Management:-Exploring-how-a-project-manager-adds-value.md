# Project managers

 Project managers guide projects from start to finish using impeccable organizational and interpersonal skills at every stage. They add values for the team, employing prioritization, delegation, and effective communication to contribute to both the team and the organization.



### - **Prioritization**

 Effectively prioritizing tasks can lead to better project outcomes. Project managers assist the team and organization by efficiently prioritizing tasks required to complete the project. They are experts in helping team members identify large tasks and break them down into smaller steps. To determine the priority of tasks, project managers communicate with the team and stakeholders to gather information and develop plans by selecting the most critical factors for project success. **Stakeholders** are individuals who, like organizational leaders, are impacted by or have an interest in the completion and success of the project.



### - **Delegation**

 Project managers should be able to assign tasks to the individuals best suited to perform each task effectively.


 
### - **Effective communication**

 Project managers need to effectively communicate with the team and stakeholders, which involves presenting plans and ideas transparently and conveying information clearly. They should communicate regularly with the team about the progress of tasks and identify areas where team members need support. Additionally, they need to communicate with external individuals, such as company leaders investing in the project.



# Key project manager roles and responsibilities



### - **Planning and organizing**

  - Making use of productivity tools and creating processes.
  - Create plans, timelines, schedules, and other forms of documentation to track project completion



### - **Budgeting and controlling costs, and other factors**

  - Monitor and manage the budget
  - Track issues and risks as they arise  
  - Manage quality by mitigating those issues and risks
  - Removing unforeseen barriers that come up.



### - **Managing task**

  - Keeping track of tasks is a great way to help manage the team's workload and ensure that things are getting done.
  - Also a great tool for demonstrating progress to people outside the immediate team, like your stakeholders.



#### Example

 Back when I was a program manager in Student Development here at Google, one of our goals was to create pathways for students who identify with communities that are underrepresented in the technology industry. A large part of my day-to-day responsibilities involved working with two separate engineering teams to create our technical curriculum. To manage the tasks associated with this project, I created separate project trackers for each team that outline the vision for the curriculum. These trackers kept both teams in the loop about the timeline for delivery, the categories and subcategories for work, and the team members assigned to each task, I also made sure to update our stakeholders every step of the way. By actively managing tasks throughout the project lifecycle, I was able to keep tabs on everyone's work and efficiently inform stakeholders, which allowed us to achieve our project goal with minimal issues. 



## Responsibilities that utilize interpersonal skills

**Interpersonal skills** are the behaviors you use to interact with others, such as communication, active listening, and leadership.

- **Teaching and mentoring**

When you take the time to fully explain the expectations, you eliminate rework, confusion, and frustration. Mentoring and teaching others the lessons that you, as a project manager, have learned allows your team to make better choices and build on your experience. Mentoring also involves supporting each individual on your team in meeting expectations and helping them to exceed their own sense of personal potential.

- **Building relationships**

Getting to know your team members lets them know that you care about them as people, not just as employees. Taking the time to *build relationships* with your customers, clients, vendors, and other stakeholders is equally important. *Dedicate* time to check in with people. *Pay attention* to the insights they offer you about their work style since their actions can inform how to most effectively interact with them. *Ask* about their lives beyond the project, and then follow up on those discussions later on to show your interest. When you foster these relationships, you are all more invested in the success of your project.

- **Controlling change**

Projects change as you continue to understand the expectations and the needs of your stakeholders. As a project manager, you need to remain flexible and adjust to the stakeholders’ needs. However, it is also important to protect your team from constant change and rework. As the project manager, you are responsible for protecting your team.

A good way to do this is by documenting the initial expectations of the project and clearly identifying the changes being requested. It is also helpful to understand the budget and schedule impact of the changes and make sure that the stakeholders understand those impacts.

- **Empowering your team**

Giving your team the ability to work directly with the stakeholders and their teams lets them know that you trust and believe in their skills! One of the best things about empowering your team is getting fresh ideas and passionate employees willing to help find solutions to problems. Another way you can empower your team is by delegating responsibilities to them, allowing them to make some decisions for the project, and using their input in the planning and execution of the project.

- **Communicating status and concerns**

With effective communication, you can work together with your team to find solutions to challenges. The project manager sets the tone for the project. Maintaining an open door policy and building trust within your team and among stakeholders—all while staying positive—will help the success of the project.



## A project manager’s role within a team

A project manager is not often the direct manager of the people working on a project team. 
With the help of your team, you can get a lot more done **together**.
Each person will be an expert on their portion of the project, but no one will be an expert on every aspect of the project, and honestly, neither will you.
As the project manager, you won't be an expert in every project role, and that's okay.  
As we said, your job isn't to be the expert on everything. 
Instead you're responsible for guiding your team and making sure that they have the support that they need in order to complete the project.

> A project manager isn't always the direct manager of each member of the project team. Rather, they're responsible for guiding those people and ensuring they have the support they need to complete the project.

- First, you'll need to hold all team members accountable for their assigned tasks. Managing tasks will help you hold your team members accountable by giving them ownership over specific pieces of the project. 
- Second, you'll need to ensure that issues and risks are tracked and visible, and be able to establish escalation paths. Now by escalation paths, I mean that you should know how you will communicate risks to the right people at the right time. 
- Third, you'll need to understand and help teammates adopt the right workflows and project management styles. As the project manager, you'll likely have the best idea of which style is best for the work. It's your job to ensure that the team adheres to that style and the other systems in place. 
- Fourth, you'll need to collaborate with other teams at the organization to meet the requirements based on project, scope, schedule, and budget. In other words, a project may affect not only your team, but other teams at an organization, as well as, say, the marketing or the finance team. So you'll need to work with those teams to ensure that everyone is happy with the project outcomes.



## **Working with cross-functional teams**

A **cross-functional team** includes team members who have different backgrounds, types of expertise, and job functions but they are all working towards a common goal: the successful completion of your project. 
Sometimes the members of a cross-functional team are referred to as “T-shaped professionals.” 
They are skilled in how to collaborate and innovate with those in different job functions and across different departments, but they also contribute their own specific areas of expertise.


![cross-functional team](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cascalpascal/Golden/main/File%20Archive/Pasted%20image%2020240315102202.png?token=GHSAT0AAAAAACOMKHYFEBOH4JDAN2XTGSNGZPXEKZA)




### - **Clarify goals**

When working with cross-functional teams, it is important to ensure that each member of the team understands their role, how they support each other, and the common goals of the project. 
It is vital to set clear goals for the team and make sure that the team understands those goals. 
*Be direct and concise, avoiding extraneous details and explanations.* 
When communicating task or project goals, make sure you define key items, such as budget, deadlines, quality requirements, or important resources. 
Your project may be competing against other priorities, so communicating clearly and often with your team—and vice versa—helps you identify any potential issues or concerns before they arise.



### - **Get team members with the right skills**

Making sure you have team members with the correct skill sets for each of the project functions is critical. 
As the project manager, you must help ensure that your team has the right people with the right skill sets needed for the project to succeed.



### - **Measure progress**

Showing your team how much they have accomplished helps keep them motivated. 
This helps everyone see the full picture and recognize their impact on the project. 
You can measure progress in many ways, including meeting key milestones, completing project tasks, and meeting project goals on time and within budget.
Regularly communicate with your team members to check on their progress. 
Ask them if they anticipate being finished on time. 
If not, ask how you can help them succeed.

Keep track of the team’s progress throughout the project by *documenting* when tasks and goals are completed, and let your team members know if the project is on track or not. 
Make sure you communicate successes, delays, or issues, to the team so they know how the project is progressing.



### - **Recognize efforts**

As a project manager, it is your job to make sure that each member of your cross-functional team recognizes the value of their efforts each step of the way. 
Learning what makes your team members feel supported, giving and taking feedback, and being mindful of each individual's background, personal identifiers, and work style can help mediate some of the differences among team members.

> Being able to communicate clearly with team members, clarify the goals of the project, get team members with the right skills, measure team progress, and recognize team members’ efforts is an important part of your role as the project manager, and is key to your project’s success.



## **The core skills of project manager**



### - **Enabling decision making**

You can help team members feel empowered from the start of your project by making the decision-making process collaborative. 
Empowering your team to express their opinions and make their own decisions allows you to focus on the overarching management tasks and prioritize them in order of importance. 
Additionally, when you allow team members to have a voice in decisions, it helps foster an environment of responsibility, accountability, and team closeness. 

You'll ensure that projects stay on schedule by gathering information from teammates and using those insights to help the team make informed decisions. 
You'll also make sure that those decisions are communicated to the necessary coworkers, whether that's the immediate team or company leaders. 



### - **Communication and escalating**

Project management requires clearly communicating project goals and expectations, team member roles and responsibilities, and constructive feedback. 
Knowing how to effectively communicate and when to escalate issues to management is key to keeping you, your team, and your organization on the path to success. 
When escalation is required, try to approach management with both the problem and the potential solution or suggestions. 
This will show that you’re taking initiative as a project manager.



### - **Flexibility**

As a project manager, knowing how to be flexible when changes are needed is key.



#### **Flexibile planning**

The flexible planning strategies can help you manage your project during times of unpredictability:

- **Assess external constraints**. When planning your project, take external events into account, such as national holidays and team member vacations and sick leave. *Leaving extra time in the schedule* for these inevitable events up front can help minimize the impact to your project.
- **Plan for risks and challenges**. If you consider the risks that may occur, you may be able to find solutions for them in advance. For example, list a roster of potential team members who can join if one of the team members becomes unavailable: whether we can hire replacements internally or employ independent contractors.
- **Calculate “float” in your schedule**. Float, or slack, refers to the amount of time you can wait to begin a task before it impacts the project schedule and threatens the project outcome. *Identifying float in your schedule* can help with resource management, scheduling, and keeping your project on track.



#### **Handling ambiguity**

Project managers often face ambiguity in goals, requirements, schedules, vision, or other areas related to the project. 
Here are some different ways to help your team deal with ambiguity:

- **Keep calm**. In uncertain times, handling ambiguity with grace and poise will help inspire the members of your team to do the same.
- **Express empathy**. As a project manager, it is important to try to understand what your team is thinking and feeling, especially during times of ambiguity. Let your team members know that you care about the challenges they are facing and are there to support them.
- **Communicate what you know clearly**. This helps your team get a better sense of what to expect, regardless of any aspects of the project that are still unknown or changing.
- **Make decisions and stick to them**. *Try not to second-guess your decisions in front of your team* since this can lead to greater uncertainty. If you need to change course, clearly explain why you have chosen to do so to your team.
- **Trust the expertise of your team**. Increase clarity by having everyone on your team discuss what they already know or believe to be true about components of your project, such as what is involved in specific tasks or resources needed, based on their areas of expertise.



### - **Strong organizational skills**

If you demonstrate that it is important for you, as a leader, to stay organized through efficient tracking and communications, your team will follow suit. 
One way to do this is by utilizing the abundance of organizational tools available, such as:

- Planning and scheduling software (templates, workflows, calendars)
- Collaboration tools (email, collaboration software, dashboards)
- Documentation (files, plans, spreadsheets)
- Quality assurance tools (evaluations, productivity trackers, reports)



## Leadership and team dynamics



### Influencing without authority

A project manager's ability to guide teammates to complete their assigned work without acting as their direct managers.



### Key interpersonal skills

- **Communication**. In the context of leading a team, communication can include checking in with teammates to understand how they're progressing on a task and providing clear feedback on the quality of a teammate's work.
- **Negotiation**. You'll need to use your negotiation skills often with your teammates and stakeholders to balance their needs and what is best for the project.
- **Conflict mediation**. Conflict mediation is a great skill to practice and develop to ensure the project does not suffer as a result.
- **Understanding motivations**. This means getting to know your teammates and figuring out what pushes them to do their best work. Understanding motivations might also include learning how your teammates prefer to receive feedback, and how they like to receive recognition for doing a great job.
