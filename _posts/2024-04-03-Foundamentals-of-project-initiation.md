# Initiation is the first phase within the project life cycle
Because initiation is the first phase of the project, it's really important to get it right. A well-planned initiation results in a strong foundation for your project, and sets it up for success.

It's project manager's responsibility to help identify the project goals, resources, and other details based on initial discussions with the project stakeholders. Even though someone else might come up with an idea for the project, it's still your job to figure out all the important pieces that need to come together in order to get the work done.

The initiation phase is a crucial time for asking stakeholders the *right questions*, *performing research*, *determining resources*, and *clearly documenting the key components* of a project. Doing this will help you solidify the scope, or the boundary, of the project.

Getting on the same page and gaining clarity during the initiation phase can save a lot of time and extra work for everyone throughout the project. Proper initiation also helps ensure that the benefits of the project outcomes will outweigh the costs of the project. To determine this, you'll do what's called a **cost benefit analysis**, which is the process of adding up the expected value of a project (the benefits) and comparing them to the dollar costs. The benefits of a project should always outweigh the costs, so it's really important that you consider these questions early on.

## Performing a cost-benefit analysis
A cost-benefit analysis can minimize risks and maximize gains for projects and organizations. It can help you communicate clearly with stakeholders and executives and keep your project on track.

When you’re pursuing a project, *the benefits should outweigh the costs*. It’s important for you and your stakeholders to consider questions like the ones that follow early on, while you prepare the proposal.

To determine the **benefits** of a project, you might ask:

- What value will this project create? 
- How much money could this project save our organization? 
- How much money will it bring in from existing customers? 
- How much time will be saved? 
- How will the user experience be improved?

And to determine the **costs** of a project, consider questions such as:

- How much time will people have to spend on this project? 
- What will be the one-time costs? 
- Are there any ongoing costs? 
- What about long-term costs?

You might also consider questions about **intangible benefits**. These are gains that are not quantifiable, such as:

- **Customer satisfaction**. Will the project increase customer retention, causing them to spend more on the company’s products or services? 
    
- **Employee satisfaction**. Is the project likely to improve employee morale, reducing turnover? 
    
- **Employee productivity**. Will the project reduce employee’s overtime hours, saving the company money?
    
- **Brand perception**. Is the project likely to improve the company’s brand perception and recognition, attracting more customers or providing a competitive advantage?

You can also flip these questions to consider **intangible costs**. These are costs that are not quantifiable. For example, might the project put customer retention, employee satisfaction, or brand perception at risk?

## Calculating costs and benefits
The process of calculating costs and benefits is also called calculating **return on investment**, or **ROI**. There are many ways to determine a project’s ROI, but the easiest way is to compare the upfront and ongoing costs to its benefits over time.

One common ROI formula is:

$$(G-C)/C=ROI$$

- **G** : the financial gains you expect from the project
- **C** : the upfront and ongoing costs of your investment in the project.
  
ROI is typically expressed as a percentage, with a positive value indicating profit from the investment and a negative value indicating loss. A strong ROI is typically considered to be anything above *10%*, and the higher the ROI, the more successful the investment is considered.

# Key components of project initation

- **Goals**
	The goal is what you've been asked to do and what you're trying to achieve. All projects should have clear goals and often those will be determined by senior company leaders, with your help. 
	
- **Scope**
	This is the process to define the work that needs to happen to complete the project.
	
- **Deliverables**
	They're the products and services that you will create for your customer, client or project sponsor. Deliverables can be anything from product features and functionalities to documentation, processes and more, anything that enables the goal of your project to be achieved. Deliverables are submitted to help you reach your project goals. Also, it's important to keep in mind that the deliverables can be tangible or intangible. 
	
- **Success criteria**
	Success criteria are the standards by which you measure how successful a project was in reaching its goals. 
	
- **Stakeholders**
	Stakeholders are key to making informed decisions at every step of the project, including the initiation phase. As you move through the initiation phase, it's your job to ensure that you *understand the needs* of the project stakeholders early on. It's also your role to ensure that *all stakeholders are in agreement on the goals and overall mission* of the project before moving on to the next phase. 
	
- **Resources**
	Resources generally refer to the budget, people, materials, and other items that you will have at your disposal. It's super important to think carefully about these pieces early on.

## Project charter
A project charter is a document that contains all the details of the project. Project charters clearly define the project and its goals and outline what is needed to accomplish them. A project charter allows you to get organized, set up a framework for what needs to be done and communicate those details to others. Once you've drafted the charter, you would then review the document with key stakeholders to get their approval to move into the planning stage.
