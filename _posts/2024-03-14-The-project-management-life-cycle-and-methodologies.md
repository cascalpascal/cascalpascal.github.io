# Project life cycle



### - Initiate the project

 You'll define project goals and deliverables, identify the budget and resources you'll need, the people involved in your project, and any other details that can impact the successful completion of your project. You'll document all this information in one place to showcase the project's value, and hopefully get approval to move forward with it. 



### - Make a plan

 Once the project is approved, it's time to get rolling. You'll make a plan for how you will meet the goals of your project. There are all kinds of ways to plan your project, and we'll get into some different methods and techniques later on. Right now, the important thing to know is that for every single project, creating a plan of how you're going to meet your goals is absolutely 100 percent essential. To be effective, your plan needs to include a lot of things. For example, a budget, a breakdown of all the tasks that you need to be completed, ways to communicate team roles and responsibilities, a schedule, resources, and what to do in case your project encounters problems or needs to change.



### - Execute & complete tasks

 While you might be in charge of completing certain tasks in the project, your primary tasks as the project manager are to monitor progress and keep your team motivated. You also remove any obstacles that might come up so that the tasks are executed well and on time. 



### - Close the project

 Why is it important to close? One big reason is so your team has a moment to celebrate all of their hard work. Closing the project is also a chance to evaluate how the project went. You can make note of what worked and what didn't so you can plan better for next time. Even if the project was a massive success, it's helpful to take time to reflect. Closing the project is also a great way to connect with anyone outside your team who may have had interest in the project's goal. You can let everyone know what was completed and what you accomplished.

## Case study: The significance of each project phase

 It’s Friday night when Jason, a project manager at a company that specializes in virtual reality software, receives an urgent call from his manager, Mateo. Mateo tells Jason that he needs a cost and timeline for a virtual reality training program for Flight Simulators, Inc., a company that does aircraft maintenance, by the end of the weekend.

- **The consequences of rushing through a project phase**

 Jason spends the weekend working through a proposal for Flight Simulators, Inc. He quickly throws together a proposal estimating that it will cost $200,000 and take six weeks to develop the course. This is the standard cost and time frame for developing training on his company’s platform. He sends the proposal over to Flight Simulators, Inc. so that he can meet their deadline.

 When Jason walks into the office on Monday morning, Mateo tells him that he got reprimanded for not following the company’s process for building out a proposal and including the engineers in the process. The engineers take a look at the information presented by Flight Simulators, Inc. and realize that the company’s software won’t work with their platform. It will take six months to develop their platform to meet the needs of the organization’s software and another six months to test the software and platform integration. The cost to develop and test this software will be over a million dollars.

 This project has failed before it even started. There’s no way to complete the request from Flight Simulators, Inc. without impacting the budget, quality, and timeline.

- **What should have happened**

 When his manager calls, Jason tells him that while he understands that Mateo wants to make the customer happy by getting them a proposal promptly, he would like to take a little more time to get the proposal right. Jason tells Mateo that he will draft up an email to Flight Simulators, Inc. and request additional time to develop an accurate and reasonable proposal. Mateo is hesitant but agrees. 

 On Monday morning, Jason sees that Flight Simulators, Inc. has responded to his request. They appreciate the fact that he communicated his concerns about the quick turnaround on the proposal request. They say they will give him a week to work with his team to provide an estimate for the project.  

 Now Jason has the time to get all of the key players involved in estimating the effort it will take to complete the project, including the cost, schedule, and resources.



### Apply the project life cycle


#### 1. Initiating the project
   
- Discusses project goals with Flight Simulators, Inc. to gain a *clear understanding of what they are asking for*.

- Once Jason has defined the project goals, he can gather the stakeholders and project team members to define *what needs to be done* to successfully create this training for Flight Simulators, Inc.

- Jason identifies the skill sets required, the timeline, and the cost to develop the training. He *identifies and documents the value that this project creates for the company*.

- He presents all of the information he has put together to his company’s leadership team, who approves Jason’s proposal.

- Jason then submits the proposal to Flight Simulators, Inc., and they accept it.


#### 2. Making a plan

- Having a plan in place ensures that all team members and stakeholders are prepared to complete their tasks.

- Jason *outlines the important deadlines and tasks* for the project to be successful. He creates a schedule to account for all resources, materials, and tasks needed to complete the project.


#### 3. Executing and completing tasks

- Jason’s project team puts his plan in motion by executing the work.

- Jason monitors his team as they complete project tasks. His role as the project manager is not to complete the individual tasks but to *help break down any barriers* that would slow or stop the team from completing their tasks.

- It is also Jason’s responsibility to *communicate schedule and quality expectations*. Jason uses his communication skills to keep Flight Simulators, Inc. up to date on the project status and gather feedback from them.


#### 4. Closing the project

- Jason’s team has successfully completed the training, and he delivers it to Flight Simulators, Inc. They are very pleased with how it turned out!

- Before he closes this chapter, Jason and his team *discuss and document the lessons learned from the project.* What worked well, and what could work better next time?

>  It is your job as the project manager to make sure that your leadership truly understands the risk of not properly preparing for a project. Making **assumptions** that are incorrect can put your company at risk. Instead, taking the time to carefully initiate, plan, execute, and close your project leads to project success and good working relationships with customers.


---



## Initiate the project

- **Define project goals**. It makes the details of your project clear so that you and your team can successfully complete the project.

- **Find out what resources are available**. Resources can include people, equipment, software programs, vendors, physical space or locations, and more. Anything you need to actually complete the project is considered a resource.

- **Get project approval**. You'll record all of these details in your project proposal and then get them approved by a decision maker or group of decision makers at your company so that you can move ahead with your project plans.



## Make a plan

> Planning is key to reducing those risks.

- **Create a budget**.

- **Set the schedule**.

- **Establish your team**.

- **Determine roles and responsibilities**.

- **Plan for risk and change**. Scheduling delays, budget changes, technology and software requirements, legal issues, quality control, and access to resources are just some of the more common types of risks and changes that a project manager needs to consider.

 Once you have a plan, you'll communicate all of this information to your team. That way, each member will know which tasks they'll own and what to do if they have questions or if they run into problems. You'll also communicate your plan with others who have an interest in the project success, so that they are aware of your plans and your progress as the project continues to move forward. 



## Executing & complete tasks

- **Manage the progress**. You'll oversee your team's efforts and make sure everyone understands what's expected of them, what tasks need to be done, and how and when to complete those tasks.

- **Communicate**.  It's also your job to help remove any obstacles and to alert the right people if it looks like there might be a delay to the project. You'll need to communicate with your team, and anyone else involved in your project through meetings, written communications like memos, emails or internal chat tools, and other working documents like task reports.

> Pro tip, **if in doubt, err on the side of overcommunication**.

- **Make adjustments**. As your project progresses you'll make adjustments to the schedule, budget, and allocation of resources, clearly communicating updates all along the way. 



## Close the project

- **Ensure all tasks have been completed**. Including any work that was added along the way. Be sure any outstanding invoices have been paid, resources are returned and accounted for, and project documentation has been submitted. 

- **Confirm acceptance of the project outcome**. Get confirmation that the final outcome of your project is acceptable to the people you're delivering it to. It is crucial to your project's success that the person who asked you to manage the project is satisfied with the end result. 

- **Reflect on lessons learned**. Take some time to reflect on what went well and maybe what didn't go so well. This reflection is usually called a retrospective, and it's a chance to note best practices and learn how to manage your project more effectively next time, even if everything went great. The notes from your retrospective are also valuable to the people or organization receiving the end result of the project. That's because they can use that information to inform decisions about their business the next time they consider a project.

- **Communicate results with stakeholders**. Collect all the project documentation that you created or collected along the way, including all of your plans and reflections, and share the final results of your project with your stakeholders. 

> Pro tip, **stakeholders play a huge role in the development, and success of your project**.

- **Celebrate completing the project**. Celebrations help people feel good about the work they've done, and think of the work as uplifting and rewarding because it truly is.

## Summary of the project life cycle

![Summary of the project life cycle](https://github.com/cascalpascal/cascalpascal.github.io/blob/master/assets/images/favicon/Pasted%20image%2020240317152855.png?raw=true)



### Initiate the project

 In this phase, ask questions to help set the foundation for the project, such as:
 
- Who are the stakeholders?
- What are the client’s or customer’s goals?
- What is the purpose and mission of the project?
- What are the measurable objectives for the team?
- What is the project trying to improve? 
- When does this project need to be completed? 
- What skills and resources will the project require? 
- What will the project cost? What are the benefits?



### Make a plan

 In this phase, make a plan to get your project from start to finish. 

- Create a detailed project plan. What are the major milestones? What tasks or deliverables make up each milestone?  
- Build out the schedule so you can properly manage the resources, budget, materials, and timeline. Here, you will create an itemized budget.



### Execute the project

 In this phase, put all of your hard work from the first two phases into action.

- Monitor your project team as they complete project tasks. 
- Break down any barriers that would slow or stop the team from completing tasks. 
- Help keep the team aware of schedule and deliverable expectations.
- Address weaknesses in your process or examine places where your team may need additional training to meet the project’s goals.
- Adapt to changes in the project as they arise.



### Close the project

In this phase, close out the project.

- Identify that your team has completed all of the requested outcomes. 
- Release your team so they can support other projects within the company.
- Take time with your team to celebrate your successes!
- Pass off all remaining deliverables and get stakeholder approval.
- Document the lessons you and your team learned during the project.
- Reflect on ways to improve in the future.



### Key takeaway

 Each phase of the project life cycle has its own significance and reason for existing. By following the project life cycle, you’re ensuring that you are:

- Capturing the expectations of your customer
- Setting your project up for success with a plan
- Executing project tasks and addressing any issues that arise
- Closing out your project to capture any lessons learned

# Project management methodologies

 A project management methodology is a set of guiding principles and processes for owning a project through its life cycle. Project management methodologies help guide project managers throughout a project with steps to take, tasks to complete, and principles for managing the project overall.



### Linear

 Linear means the previous phase or task has to be completed before the next can start. Using this type of linear project management approach, completing each step in order and sticking to the agreed upon specific results and being able to deliver just what the client ordered. 

 Linear projects don't require many changes during development and have a clear sequential process. If you stick to the plan, it's likely you'll finish your tasks within the time schedule and all other criteria.

### Iterative

 Iterative means some of the phases and tasks will overlap or happen at the same time that other tasks are being worked on. Plans remain flexible and you're able to make adjustments as you go along.

 Iterative projects allow for more flexibility and anticipate changes. You're able to test out parts of the project to make sure they work before the final result is delivered, and you can deliver parts of the project as they are completed, rather than waiting for the entire project to be done.

## Introduction of Waterfall and Agile


### Waterfall

 Waterfall as a methodology was created in the 70s, and refers to the sequential ordering of phases. You complete one at a time down the line like a waterfall starting at the top of a mountain and traveling to the bottom. Waterfall has a *linear approach*. 

 At first, Waterfall was used in the physical engineering disciplines like manufacturing and construction, then software emerged as an important field of engineering and Waterfall was applied to those projects as well. It still used a lot in engineering fields including product feature design and application, also known as app design. Over time, other industries like event planning and retail have adapted Waterfall phases to fit their projects. 

> What they all have in common, though, is that they follow an ordered set of steps that are directly linked to clearly defined expectations, resources, and goals that are not likely to change.

 The phases of a Waterfall project life cycle follow the same standard project life cycle flow that initiating, planning, executing, which includes managing and completing tasks, and closing. When would you want to use a Waterfall approach to project management? Well, when the phases of the project are clearly defined or when there are tasks to complete before another can begin, or when changes to the project are very expensive to implement once it's started. 

 A well-thought-out traditional approach to managing a project can help you reach your desired outcome with as little pain as possible during the project implementation. 

 Waterfall method has some risk management practices to help avoid and deal with project changes.



### Agile

 Projects that use an Agile approach often have many tasks being worked on at the same time, or in various stages of completion which makes it an iterative approach.

 The concepts that shaped Agile methodology began to emerge in the 90s as a response to the growing demand for faster delivery of products, mainly software applications at that time. But it wasn't officially named Agile until 2001. 

 The phases of an Agile project also follow the project life cycle stages we described earlier, generally speaking. However, rather than having to always go in order or wait for one phase to end before starting the next, *Agile project phases overlap and tasks are completed in iterations, which in Scrum, are called sprints*. **Scrum** is a form of Agile. **Sprints** are short chunks of time usually one to four weeks where a team works together to focus on completing specific tasks. 

 Agile is more of a *mindset* than just a series of steps or phases. It's concerned with building an effective, collaborative team that seeks regular feedback from the client so that they can deliver the best value as quickly as possible and adjust as changes emerge. 

 Projects that are best suited for an Agile approach are those where the client has an idea of what they want but doesn't have a concrete picture in mind, or they have a set of qualities they'd like to see in the end result, but aren't as concerned with exactly what it looks like. Another indicator that a project may benefit from Agile is the level of high uncertainty and risk involved with the project.

## Introduction to Lean and Six Sigma

 Lean Six Sigma is a combination of two parent methodologies, Lean and Six Sigma. The uses for Lean Six Sigma are common in projects that have goals to save money, improve quality, and move through processes quickly. It also focuses on team collaboration which promotes a positive work environment. The idea is that when your team feels valued, motivation and productivity increases and the whole process functions more smoothly.

 There are five phases in the Lean Six Sigma approach. They are *define*, *measure*, *analyze*, *improve*, and *control*, commonly known as **DMAIC**. DMAIC is a strategy for process improvement, meaning you're trying to figure out where the problems are in the current process and fix them so that everything runs more smoothly. The goal of each step is to ensure the best possible results for your project. What's great about the DMAIC process is that it can be used to solve any business problem.

- **DeFine**. The first phase is to define the project goal and what it will take to meet it. This first phase is very similar to the initiation phase of traditional project management. 
- **Measure**. In order to improve processes, DMAIC focuses on *data*. Here you want to map out the current process and locate exactly where the problems are and what kind of effect the problems have on the process. 
- **Analyze**.Once you have the data and measurements, you can move on to the next phase which is analyze. You'll begin to identify gaps and issues. Data analysis is important for project managers regardless of which method you choose. From your data, you'll have a strong understanding of causes and solutions to get to the next stage, improve.
- **Improve**. This is the point where you present your findings and get ready to start making improvements. 
- **Control**. You've gotten the process and project to a good place, and now it's time to implement it and keep it there. Controlling is all about learning from the work you did up front to put new processes and documentation in place and continue to *monitor* so the company doesn't revert back to the old, inefficient way of doing things. 

 Lean Six Sigma and the DMAIC approach are ideal when the project goal includes improving the current process to fix complex or high risk problems like improving sales, conversions, or eliminating a bottleneck, which is when things get backed up during a process. Following the DMAIC process prevents the likelihood of skipping important steps and increases the chances of a successful project. As a way for your team to discover best practices that your client can use going forward, it uses data and focuses on the customer or end-user to solve problems in a way that builds on previous learning so that you can discover effective permanent solutions for difficult problems. 



### Lean

 Lean methodology is often referred to as Lean Manufacturing because it originated in the manufacturing world. The main principle in Lean methodology is the removal of waste within an operation. By optimizing process steps and eliminating waste, only value is added at each phase of production.

 In the manufacturing industry, these types of waste are often attributed to issues such as:

- Lack of proper documentation
- Lack of process standards
- Not understanding the customers’ needs
- Lack of effective communication
- Lack of process control
- Inefficient process design
- Failures of management
  
 These same issues create waste in project management.

 Implement Lean project management when you want to use limited resources, reduce waste, and streamline processes to gain maximum benefits. You can achieve this by using the pillars of the Lean **5S** quality tool. Implementing the 5S method means cleaning up and organizing the workplace to achieve the smallest amount of wasted time and material.

1. **Sort**. Remove all items not needed for current production operations and leave only the bare essentials. 
2. **Set in order**. Arrange needed items so that they are easy to use. Label items so that anyone can find them or put them away. 
3. **Shine**. Keep everything in the correct place. Clean your workspace every day.
4. **Standardize**. Perform the process in the same way every time. 
5. **Sustain**. Make a habit of maintaining correct procedures and instill this discipline in your team.

 The final concept of Lean uses a **Kanban** scheduling system to manage production. The Kanban scheduling system, or Kanban board, is a visualization tool that enables you to optimize the flow of your team’s work. It gives the team a visual display to identify what needs to be done and when. The Kanban board uses cards that are moved from left to right to show progress and help your team coordinate the work.

![Kanban board](https://github.com/cascalpascal/cascalpascal.github.io/blob/master/assets/images/favicon/Pasted%20image%2020240317165437.png?raw=true)



### Six Sigma

 Six Sigma is a methodology used to reduce variations by ensuring that quality processes are followed every time. The term “Six Sigma” originates from statistics and generally means that items or processes should have 99.9996% quality. Use this methodology to find aspects of the product or process that are _measurable_ like time, cost, or quantity. Then inspect that measurable item and reject any products that do not meet the Six Sigma standard.

 The seven key principles of Six Sigma are:

1. Always focus on the customer.
2. Identify and understand how the work gets done. Understand how work really happens.
3. Make your processes flow smoothly.
4. Reduce waste and concentrate on value.
5. Stop defects by removing variation.
6. Involve and collaborate with your team.
7. Approach improvement activity in a systematic way.

> **Lean Six Sigma**
> 
>  After both Lean and Six Sigma were put into practice, it was discovered that the two methodologies could be combined to increase benefits. The tools used in Lean, such as *Kanban* boards and *5S*, build quality in processes from the beginning. Products developed using Lean methods are then inspected or tested using *Six Sigma standards*. The products that do not meet these standards are rejected.



### Popular project management approaches

- **Waterfall**. In Waterfall, the criteria used to measure quality is clearly defined at the beginning of the project. The project manager is responsible for prioritizing and assigning tasks to team members.
- **Agile**. In Agile projects, teams share responsibility for managing their own work. Some phases and tasks happen at the same time as others. 
- **Scrum** is an Agile framework that focuses on developing, delivering, and sustaining complex projects and products through collaboration, accountability, and an iterative process. Work is completed by small, cross-functional teams led by a Scrum Master and is divided into short Sprints with a set list of deliverables.
- **Kanban** is a tool used in both Agile and Lean approaches that provides visual feedback about the status of the work in progress through the use of Kanban boards or charts.
- **Lean** uses the 5S quality tool to eliminate eight areas of waste, save money, improve quality, and streamline processes. Lean’s principles state that you can do more with less by addressing dysfunctions that create waste. Lean implements a Kanban scheduling system to manage production.
- **Six Sigma** involves reducing variations by ensuring that quality processes are followed every time. The Six Sigma method follows a process-improvement approach called DMAIC, which stands for define, measure, analyze, improve, and control.
- **Lean Six Sigma**. It is often used in projects that aim to save money, improve quality, and move through processes quickly. Lean Six Sigma is also ideal for solving complex or high-risk problems.
