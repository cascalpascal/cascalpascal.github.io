# Organizational structure  
  
>The way a company or organization is arranged or structured.  
  
This structure also tells you how job tasks are divided and coordinated and how all the different members of the organization relate to one another. In other words, organizational structure gives you a sense of who reports to who.  
  
Understanding the different types of organizational structures can serve as a map to help you determine where you fit in, who you should communicate with, and how frequently to communicate with them.  
  
An organization's structure is most commonly mapped out using a reporting chart or "org chart," which is short for "organizational chart." Reporting charts show the relationship between people and groups within the organization, and details who each person or group reports to.

In both Classic and Matrix organizations, project managers must clearly define roles and responsibilities in order to work effectively. However, within most Matrix organizations, some project managers or department leads may have the same level of authority as the functional managers and operate more directly.

<br>

## Classic structure

>Traditional top-down system of reporting  
  
The Classic grouping includes what are usually called "functional" or "top-down" structures. The department manager has direct authority over several other sections of employees. This system requires communication both up and down the ladder. In a Classic structure, authority comes from the top and filters to the bottom. Each department is led by a functional manager, and employees are grouped according to the functions of their role. 

If your organization works in this structure, as the project manager, you might communicate regularly with your manager, *the person directly above you*, and also with *your peers* who work on the same types of projects as you. 

<br>

## Matrix structure  
  
>Direct higher-ups and stakeholders from other departments or programs  
  
The Matrix structure differs from the Classic structure in that the employees have two or more managers. In Matrix structures, you still have people above you, but you also have people in *adjacent* departments with whom you will need to communicate on your work progress. Functional areas tend to cross paths more frequently, and depending on the nature of the work, the responsible manager for each area has the most authority. You can think of the project manager as being a temporary manager while assigned to the team.

## Delineation of Responsibilities

### Project manager's responsibilities

1. What is to be done?
2. When will the task be done?
3. Why will the task be done?
4. How much money is available to do the task?
5. How well has the total project been done?

### Functional manager's responsibilities

1. How will the task be done?
2. Where will the task be done?
3. Who will do the task?
4. How well has the functional input been integrated into the project?

## How organizational structure impacts project management

An organization's structure provides the framework for accountability and communication. As the project manager, it's vital that you understand who you're reporting to on each project, and just as importantly, who the members of your team report to. Knowing the organizational structure also tells you how and where to get the resources you'll need so you can get the project done efficiently. When you understand the organization's structure, you'll be able to identify how it impacts the way you manage the project.

- **Authority**
Authority has to do with your ability to make decisions for the project that impact the organization. 

- **Resource availability**
Knowing how to access the people, equipment, and budget that you need for a project.

### Classic structure
You might find yourself with less authority and a tighter scope. You may need to rely on getting approval from the appropriate managers, directors, and department heads in order to move forward and complete certain tasks. As a project manager working in a Classic structure, you may depend on the managers in your organization to approve resources.

### Matrix structure
Matrix structures emphasize a strong project focus from the team and the organization. You as the project manager, generally have more autonomy to make decisions and gather resources as needed. 

Your team members will have their functional manager and you, the project manager. Because there isn't always a clear chain of command in a Matrix structure, you need to make sure you have identified and communicated with anyone you might need to report to and get approval from well before the project begins.

## The role of a Project Management Office

A Project Management Office, or PMO, is a group within an organization that defines, sets, and helps maintain project management standards and processes throughout that organization.

The key purposes of a PMO include: strategic planning and governance, implementing project management best practices, establishing common project culture, resource management, and creating project documentation, archives, and tools. 

PMOs support their organizations in managing large numbers of projects and help keep all employees working in the same direction towards the organization’s goals. 

### What are the functions of a PMO?
PMOs offer guidance and support to their organization’s project managers. They share best practices, project statuses, and direction for all of the organization’s projects while often taking on strategic projects themselves.

- **Strategic planning and governance**
This involves defining project criteria, selecting projects according to the organization’s business goals, and then providing a business case for those projects to management.

- **Best practices**
PMOs help implement best practices and processes within their organization. They also share lessons learned from previous successful projects. They help ensure consistency among their organization’s projects by providing guidance about processes, tools, and metrics.

- **Common project culture**
PMOs help set common project culture practices by training employees about optimal approaches and best practices. This helps keep project management practices consistent and efficient across the entire organization.

- **Resource management**
PMOs are often responsible for managing and allocating resources—such as people and equipment—across projects throughout the organization based on budget, priorities, schedules, and more. They also help define the roles and responsibilities needed on any given project. PMOs provide training, mentoring, and coaching to all employees, but project managers in particular. 

- **Creation of project documentation, archives, and tools**
PMOs invest in and provide templates, tools, and software to help manage projects. They also play an important role in maintaining their organization’s project history. Once a project closes, they archive all of the documents created during the project for future reference and to capture lessons learned.

# Organizational Culture

The values employees share, as well as the organization's, values, mission, and history. In other words, organizational culture can be thought of as the company's personality. Understanding an organization's culture will help you navigate your team more effectively toward achieving the project's goal. It also impacts the way you plan your project. You'll need to be familiar with an organization's culture, so that you can minimize conflict and complete the project with as much support and harmony as possible. 

If you're ever stuck in your project and need guidance about making a certain decision, or are unsure how to communicate with someone in the organization, reviewing the mission and values may help direct you toward the right way to handle that situation.

Consider the following questions:
- How do people prefer to communicate? Is it primarily through scheduled meetings, via email, over the phone? 
- How are decisions made, majority vote or top down approvals? 
- What kinds of rituals are in place when someone new comes to the office? Are they taken out to lunch, given a tour of the building or introduced to the staff? 
- How are projects typically run? Do they prefer a Classic, do they prefer Matrix, or some other style of project management? 
- What kinds of practices, behaviors, and values are reflected by the people in the organization? Is overtime or weekend work an expectation? Are there company sanctioned social events? 

Finding out what the company values, will tell you a lot about the culture. And how to handle communication, manage expectations, and identify potential conflicts as you work through your project.


**Navigating Culture**
Make sure to *ask questions*. As you observe the culture, try asking your peers what they think is going well and what they would change. It's also a good idea to *make observations*. It's important to understand how things work, and what people like and respect about the company's culture. Lastly, it's important to *understand your impact*. Be aware of your role as a change agent. A **change agent** is someone who helps the organization transform by focusing on improving organizational effectiveness and development.

<br>

# Learning about an organization's culture
Organizational culture is important because it has a direct impact on you as a project manager, and learning how to navigate organizational culture gives you a great advantage when you are executing projects. Being able to navigate departmental interactions, communicate effectively, and plan your project in line with the organization’s culture will help set you up for success in your project management career path.


> "Culture eats strategy for breakfast." - Peter Drucker


**The importance of organizational culture**

- **Identity**: An organization’s identity essentially describes the way the company conducts  business, both internally and externally. A company’s values and organizational culture go hand-in-hand; its values are part of its identity. 
- **People**: Strong, positive organizational culture helps retain a company’s best employees. People who feel valued, engaged, and challenged are more likely to give their best and want to drive for success. One way to find out more about an organization's culture is to talk to the people who work there. 
- **Processes**: Organizational culture can have direct impacts on a company's processes, and ultimately, its productivity. The organization’s culture is instilled throughout the company—from its employees to how its employees do their job. 

<br>

## Understanding an organization's culture
Some aspects of an organization’s culture that are directly related to how you will manage projects are communication, decision-making, rituals, previous management styles, and values. 

### Ask questions
You can learn about an organization's culture by asking questions of management and peers. 

### Listen to people’s stories
Listening to what current employees have to say and how they portray the company will give you great insight.

### Take note of company rituals
Rituals can be powerful drivers of culture. They engage people and help instill a sense of shared purpose and experience. 

### Understand your impact
As a project manager, you become a **change agent**. Remember: a change agent is a person from inside an organization who helps the organization transform by focusing on improving organizational effectiveness and development. When you begin a new role, sit down with management to better understand what is expected of you and how you can make the most of the opportunity.

### Shrapen your communication skills
Interpersonal communication skills are a major part of project management. How a company communicates is directly tied to its organizational culture.

To communicate effectively, you will need to understand how to navigate the different channels in your company. Ask questions about communication practices when you start a new role such as: Is it customary to sign emails from the team rather than from you individually? Should presentations include team members or be solely presented by the project manager? 

Approaching projects differently from how similar projects were managed in the past may be met with some resistance. Although some projects may call for you to break the status quo, when you show an appreciation of your organization’s culture, you may help your team members accept any improvements you are implementing.

## Case study
The Family Java coffeehouse has over 2,000 stores worldwide. The Family Java’s culture is closely linked to their strategy and capabilities—this is what they feel sets them apart from other coffee shops. The company has invested in a relationship-driven, employees-first approach. Their culture establishes that the employees are what makes the company unique.

The Family Java believes in expressing their employees-first value by spending more on employee healthcare than on coffee beans! Each employee is crucial to the success of the company and their ability to fulfill their mission and adhere to their values. In turn, the company makes their employees feel valued by offering substantial training, education scholarships, assistance with daycare, and growth within the company.

### **A project manager’s relationship to organizational culture**

**Learning the company’s values**
Avi was excited to begin his role as a project manager at The Family Java. He had asked questions about the organization’s culture during his job interview and was told about the company’s people-first approach.

**Clarifying the company’s expectations**
Avi’s manager at The Family Java said that his role would involve a substantial emphasis on team building and keeping morale high. When he began, Avi asked his manager to *clarify* the time investment expected by the company in order to accomplish team- and morale-building goals. He also asked for *suggestions* and *guidance* based on what had been done at the company in the past. 

**Applying organizational culture to a project**
Before beginning his first project, Avi planned a team lunch to get to know everyone at The Family Java. Then, he scheduled one-on-one meetings with each of his team members to learn more about their working style and professional goals. He also asked *how he could help support and remove any barriers for them*. 

One of Avi’s team members, Miguel, said that he needed to start his workday early because he picked his children up from school at 3:00. After hearing this, Avi avoided scheduling team meetings in the late afternoon. 

Another team member, Elisa, told Avi that she preferred face-to-face or phone conversations to email since she felt like she communicated better verbally. When Avi needed to discuss something with Elisa, he made sure that he talked with her in person as much as possible.

Avi continued to check in with all of his team members regularly as the project progressed. He also scheduled weekly “Coffee Chats” with his team, since he had learned that this was company tradition. 

Avi’s efforts to align his project management style to The Family Java’s organizational culture were noticed by executives and stakeholders, and he was given a lot of support in getting the resources he needed.

# Introduction to change management
 In project management, the process of delivering your completed project and getting people to adopt it is called change management. Understanding change management can ensure that a project is completed successfully and that the organization accepts and adopts the recommendations from the project. *Adoption* is often the first step to your project having the desired impact once it goes live.

It's important to recognize that it's the people in an organization who are directly impacted by any changes in the workplace. Implementing a new project can mean changes to processes, budgets, schedules, and employee roles and responsibilities.

When you consider the success of your project, it's important to keep in mind the changes that people will need to implement as a result. Thinking through these changes will set you up for success in getting your project accepted and adopted.

**Core concepts**

- Creating a sense of **ownership** and **urgency** around the project. Ownership means getting others to feel they are empowered to take responsibility for the successful completion of their tasks. Urgency means getting them to understand that the project is important and to identify what actions need to be taken to move the project along. When team members feel a sense of ownership and urgency around a project, it increases interest, motivation, and engagement with the project outcome. 
- *Figure out the right combination of skills and personalities* when selecting the people who will work on your team. Find people whose knowledge and skills complement one another. If your team is selected for you, see if you're able to choose who gets assigned which tasks. If that's not possible, then it's extra important for you to find ways to connect with your team. This will get them excited about the project so then they can be advocates for change when it's needed. One effective way of motivating your team is *to communicate clearly your vision and approach for the project.* Then you can share how you see everyone working together as a team to make it happen. Communicating this idea clearly allows others to share in your vision and take ownership in bringing it to life. 
- Communication is key. Having *effective communication with your team* means being transparent and up front with your plans and ideas and making information available. Make sure your team, along with the rest of the organization, is kept up-to-date on your progress. This will allow everyone to feel like they're included and part of the project.

<br>

## A project manager's role in change management
Your project’s success depends on the adoption and acceptance of your project—whether that entails the launch of a new external tool or a process that will change operations at a production facility. In both cases, the greatest impact of the change will be on the people who use and interact with the product or process that is changing. 

You can help ensure your project’s success by embracing changes as they come and by convincing the wider audience, whether that is the end user or members of the organization, to embrace changes, too. When you implement a careful approach to change management, you can address issues that might occur in the later stages of your project.

### Integrating projcet management and change management
As a project manager, you can think of change management as necessary for the successful outcome of your project. They also incorporate tools and processes to accomplish that goal. The most effective way to achieve a project goal is to integrate project management and change management, and it is your responsibility as a project manager to do so. 

Begin by asking yourself the following questions:
- How will the organization react to change?
- Which influencers can affect change?
- What are the best means of communication? 
- What change management practices will lead to the successful implementation of my project? 

The answers to these questions will help you prepare for a variety of possible scenarios and allow you to craft solutions to effectively support the adoption of your project.

<br>

**Best Paractice**

- **Be proactive.** Proactive and inclusive change management planning can help keep any potentially impacted stakeholders aware of the upcoming changes. You can also plan steps towards the end of your project to introduce the deliverable to stakeholders in the form of demonstrations, question and answer forums, or marketing videos. 
- **Communicate about upcoming changes.** Communication should occur regularly among impacted stakeholders, the change management team, and the project team. Check in and communicate throughout the project about how the changes will provide a better experience for end users of the project deliverables.
- **Follow a consistent process.** Following a clear change management process helps maintain consistency each time there is a change. The change management process should be established and documented early on in your project to guide how the project will handle change. 
- **Practice empathy.** Changes are inevitable, but we are often resistant to them. By being empathetic to the challenges and anxiety change can bring, you can support the process in subtle ways. 
- **Use tools.** Incorporating tools to assist in the adoption of a change can be very helpful.
	- *Feedback mechanisms*, such as surveys, can capture input from stakeholders.
	- *Flowcharts* can visualize the project's development process.
	- *Culture mapping* can illustrate the company's culture and how the company's values, norms, and employees behavior may be affected by the change.

<br>

## Participation in change management
Being empathetic to the challenges of change management can help you support the process in subtle ways. In this case, participating in change management might mean communicating with employees throughout the project about how the system will provide a better experience for their customers. 

<br>

## Corporate and project governance

**Governance** in business is the management framework within which decisions are made and accountability and responsibility are determined. 

### Corporate governance
Each organization is governed by its own set of standards and practices that direct and control its actions. Those standards and practices are called **corporate governance**, and they will influence your projects. Corporate governance is the framework by which an organization achieves its goals and objectives. Corporate governance is also a way to balance the requirements of the various corporate entities, such as stakeholders, management, and customers. Corporate governance affects every part of an organization, including action plans, internal and external controls, and performance measurements.

Governance and change management go hand-in-hand. To successfully implement change management, it is essential that you understand the structure and culture of the organization. Effective governance in change management provides clearly defined roles and responsibilities during change. 

Another example of governance within an organization is the creation and use of *steering committees*. Steering committees decide on the priorities of an organization and manage the general course of its operations. The steering committee essentially acts as an advisory board or council to help the project manager and the company make and approve strategic decisions that affect both the company and the project. 



### Project governance
As a project manager, you will be responsible for **project governance**. Project governance is the framework for how project decisions are made. Project governance helps keep projects running smoothly, on time, and within budget. Project governance involves all the key elements that make a project successful. It tells you what activities an organization does and who is responsible for those activities. Project governance covers policies, regulations, functions, processes, procedures, and responsibilities.



### How project and corporate governace intersect
Project governance needs to be tailored to your organization's specific needs. These needs will influence how you implement and monitor the governance framework on your project. Project governance concerns those areas of corporate governance that are specifically related to project activities. Effective project governance ensures that an organization’s projects are aligned to the organization’s larger objectives, are delivered efficiently, and are sustainable. 
- Considering the long- and short-term interests of your organization
- Making thoughtful decisions about which projects to take on and avoiding projects if you do not have sufficient resources
- Providing timely, relevant, and reliable information to the board of directors and other major stakeholders 
- Eliciting the input and buy-in of senior managers since they are the decision-makers 
- During the initiation phase, prioritizing clear, reachable, and sustainable goals in order to reduce confusion and conflict
- During the planning phase, assigning ownership and accountability to an experienced team to deliver, monitor, and control the process 
- During the execution phase, learning from mistakes and adapting to new or improved knowledge
Corporate governance can involve clearing many hurdles before making decisions. At the same time, corporate governance can help support project governance, as it provides oversight on compliance and mitigating risk and offers guidance and direction for project managers. Good corporate governance can also help project managers secure resources, get issues addressed, avoid delays in decision-making, get buy-in from stakeholders, and achieve visibility for projects on the executive level.
